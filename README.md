## Introduction
The game was made as a training for OOP principles, such as creating and using reusable pieces of code(**Classes** as you know them).

The GUI was made with the Python Turtle.

Game was made to play along with somebody (2-player game) so be prepared to challenge somebody.
## Technologies

2. Start the ```main.py``` from terminal or open the full **project folder** in any IDE and launch the main.py file

## Status

The game is finished. No critical bugs were noticed by me, however, in the future I think it would be nice to move the GUI from **Turtle** to **Tkinter** or something similar.
